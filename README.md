# Morse-Code-Arduino
Hardware project that takes user input and converts letters into voltages

### Description
This project requires an Arduino Uno R3 and one 5mm LED; a Raspberry Pi computer was used, but any computer with the Arduino programming language installed will work

The program can take any combination of numbers and letters and convert each character into a specific sequence of LED light flashes, mimicking morse code translation
